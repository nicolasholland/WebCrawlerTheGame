# WebCrawlerTheGame

WebCrawler The Game was a unity project, which we didn't finish.

Our main idea was to have a platformer game that works like a webcrawler, downloading images/text from the web as you play the game.
In its current state you start the game by typing in a url and the game will download all its images and display them in the level.

The levels are randomly generated from tiles.
We got the few textures we use from opengameart.org.
The unity version used was 4.5.5f1.
